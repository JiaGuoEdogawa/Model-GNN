# Model-GNN
This repository contains the code for our TWC work "A Model-Based GNN for Learning Precoding", available at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345473 and has been accepted for publication in TWC.

For any reproduce, further research or development, please kindly cite our TWC Journal paper:

`J. Guo and C. Yang, “A Model-Based GNN for Learning Precoding,” IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., accepted, 2023.`

# Requirements
The following versions have been tested: Python 3.6 + Tensorflow 1.14. But newer versions of Tensorflow 1.X should also be fine.

# Introductions
There are three folders: "`common_funcs`" and "`Precoding`", where "`Precoding`" includes four folders, "`Configs`" including the .json files of system parameters, "`Models`" including functions of GNNs and numerical algorithms, "`Dataset`" saves generated datasets, "`DNNmodel`" saves trained models, and main functions in the root folder.

# Model-GNN
## Training and Testing
Run the main program "`Main-SE-Model-GNN.py`".
